# day27_100
I am currently engaged in a 100-day Python Bootcamp, which I am documenting and sharing my progress on GitHub. The boot camp is designed to progressively intensify, allowing me to deepen my understanding and proficiency in Python programming.

Additionally, I have chosen to include the beginner, intermediate and advanced in my documentation to provide a valuable reference for my future growth and development.

# Advanced Python Arguments: *args and **kwargs
In Python, functions are highly versatile and allow for flexible parameter passing. Two powerful features that enable this flexibility are __*args__ and __**kwargs__. These constructs allow functions to accept an arbitrary number of positional and keyword arguments, respectively.

__*args__
The *args syntax allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments. The arguments are passed into the function as a tuple.
